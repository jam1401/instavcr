# Running the test

There should already be a failing cassette in the fixtures dir. To run the server use the 'shotgun config.ru' command.

This go to the port in your browser and sign into Instagram. The browser should indicate an error.

If you want to start from scratch remove the current cassette and sign-in. You will see your images from Instagram and the cassette will be created. Refresh to use the cassette and you should see the error.
